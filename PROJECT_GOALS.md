# BioSynthonos: Project Goals

This document outlines the primary, secondary, and technical goals of the BioSynthonos project.

## 1. Primary Goal: Advanced Physiological Simulation

The core objective is to develop a sophisticated, deterministic, and dynamic simulation engine that models the physiological, metabolic, and hormonal responses of a "virtual athlete" to complex external stimuli.

- **Dynamic Time-Series Model:** To move beyond static predictions and simulate week-by-week changes, capturing cumulative effects, adaptations, and recovery processes.
- **Multi-System Modeling:** To integrate multiple physiological sub-systems, including pharmacokinetics (PKE), hormonal effects (HPS), metabolism (MES), body composition (AMS), and organ health (OHS).
- **High Personalization:** To allow users to calibrate the simulation using detailed personal data, including biometrics, genetic predispositions, and baseline blood work, for more accurate and relevant predictions.

## 2. Secondary Goal: Education and Harm Reduction

The project serves as an advanced educational tool designed to promote a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between pharmacology, nutrition, and human physiology.

- **Illustrate Cause and Effect:** To clearly demonstrate the potential positive outcomes (e.g., physique changes) alongside the significant negative health consequences (e.g., adverse blood markers, organ strain) of using performance-enhancing drugs.
- **Promote Data-Driven Decision Making:** To encourage users to think critically about protocol design and the importance of monitoring key health indicators through regular blood work.
- **Harm Reduction:** While not condoning the use of these substances, the tool aims to provide a theoretical framework for harm reduction by highlighting risks and showcasing the potential impact of supportive nutritional strategies and proper post-cycle therapy.

## 3. Tertiary Goal: AI Integration and Exploration

A key exploratory goal is to leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the user experience and provide insights that are difficult to achieve with a purely deterministic model.

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** To use the Gemini API to provide a nuanced, qualitative "deep dive" into the simulation results, interpreting the data from the perspective of an expert sports scientist.
- **Intelligent Assistance:** To develop an AI-driven "Protocol Suggestion" feature that acts as an intelligent assistant, generating theoretically sound and safety-conscious protocol examples based on user goals and experience levels.

## 4. Technical Goals

- **Modern Web Application:** To build a high-performance, secure, and maintainable Single-Page Application (SPA) using a modern tech stack (Vite, React, TypeScript).
- **Robustness and Security:** To ensure secure handling of API keys through environment variables and to build a stable, error-resilient application.
- **Intuitive User Experience (UX):** To design a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface that makes complex data accessible and understandable.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** To build the application with multi-language support from the ground up, making it accessible to a global audience.
